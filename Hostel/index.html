			We broke the news of the release of the Makerere University Private Students Admission List; so the Freshers are definitely racking their brains on accommodation. No worries, we got you covered. This here, is a guide to the hostels(read most popular hostels) around MUK because trust me, if we were even to review only 10% of the hostels in Kikoni alone, we wouldn’t get done. So yeah, brace yourselves and take this ride with me around Makerere, first from Wandegeya, through Kagugube and then Kikoni:

			As you come from town along Bombo road, before you reach YMCA and the Wandegeya traffic lights. There’s a ka nice structure on your left called Karlmax Building and in it there’s Karlmax hostel. It’s a relatively affordable place and has good facilities but it is definitely not a place for a church girl. The first thing you will always smell as you enter Karlmax Building is weed – and no I won’t comment about their infamous sextape.

Opposite the Makerere Eastern Gate on that same road, there’s Maymood Hostel. Further to Wandegeya, you’ll find Aryan(Ark) Hostel; the MUK version of Akamwesi. These two are high-end hostels. By the way, I advise you to reside in Wandegeya if you are admitted on any medical degree program – distance matters, my dear. Often you’ll be forced to walk all the way from Kikoni to Mulago in blazing hot Kasana.
